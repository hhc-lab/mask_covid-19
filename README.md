The file 'covid19_maskuse.r' contains R code to run the models utilized in the manuscript 'Face mask use and resource allocation during the Covid-19 Pandemic'. The code was written, tested and implemented using R version 3.5 (cran.r-project.org), and requires the package 'deSolve' (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html). No compilation required. Demos are included which will generate epidemic curve plots under different scenarios. Run time is negligible (<5s) on a standard desktop computer.
